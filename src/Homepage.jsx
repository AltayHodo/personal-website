        🐻 💻 Im a sophomore studying at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer
        Science & Operations Research, with a minor in Data Science. I aspire to
        work as a software engineer or data scientist, and I have a passion for
        the fields of technology, mathematics, and building things with code.

        my free time, you’ll probably catch me playing basketball, working out,
        or watching the Warriors. Feel free to reach out to me about anything at <a href="mailto:altayhodo@berkeley.edu">altayhodo@berkeley.edu</a>.
